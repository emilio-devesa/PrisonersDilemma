# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Small guidelines:

- Keep changes focused and small (one feature or fix per PR).
- Follow the existing module layout (`modules/`): `shared`, `player`, `strategies`, `game`, `utils`.
- Compile locally before opening a PR.

Steps:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Add tests for your change.
4. Open a PR and describe the change and why.
